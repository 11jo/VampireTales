## GENERAL OVERVIEW :
---------------

Vampire Tales("VT") is a WeiDU-based mod for Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal.  It adds a new encounter, improves the Unseeing Eye and Harpers encounter which are slightly harder! As usual, Vampire Tales should be compatible with most other WeiDu-based mods, and should be installed after all official patches and preferably the Baldurdash Fixpack.  Vampire Tales requires the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack.

Listed below is an explanation of some of the mod's additions:

 

-    A. Magical Upgrade Store

    This adds a new store in the Morninglord Temple. She sells magical items and scrolls. If you have the right item she may be able to "enhance" or upgrade them.

-    B. The Kali Cult

    A new encounter with the members of the Kali Cult. They are in the dungeon of Firkraag's Lair. Make sure you have a high level party that is mixed with both ranged and melee. They are hard to beat trust me. *evil grin*

-    C. Improved Cult of the Unseeing Eye

    Makes some of the encounters of the Cult of the Unseeing Eye harder.

-    D. Improved Harpers

    When you have Jaheira in your party and you are summoned to the Harper Hold I made it so Galvery and his goons are harder to fight. They were too easy to kill in my opinion and I wanted to make them more challenging.

-    E. My first store mod

    My very first mod! I included it in here so you would not have to download it seperately to play it. Do NOT install it if you already have it. Strange things might happen if you do. 


## Install:
-----------

BG2EE or BGII: Throne of Bhaal is required.

**EET** : Install this mod **in your BG2EE game AFTER** EET !

Installing is simple. Double-click the vampiretales.exe file and install to your main BG2 / BG2EE directory
    Once the install program has finished, it will launce the WeiDU installer program. Simply follow the on-screen instructions in the new DOS window. 

Though this mod is made using the WeiDU standard, and *should* be compatible with all other WeiDU-based mods, there is always the possibility for conflicts.  We suggest you install this mod AFTER the official patches, Baldurdash, and TeamBG mods.  If you encounter any problems installing the mod, please our forums. 

Uninstalling is simple. Double-click the setup-vampiretales.exe file and enter the given commands for Uninstallation.
Afterwards, you may delete the following files:

    vampiretales.exe
    vampiretales.tp2
    vampiretales.debug
    and the contents of the "vampiretales" subfolder 

## Compatibility :
------------------

**This mod should work without significant issues, but it is still a work in progress.**


## FAQS
------------------

Q: What do I need to use this MOD?
A: Vampire Tales will require Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal with the latest Bioware/Interplay patches. We also strongly encourage the installation of the Baldurdash Fixpack as well.

Q: What does this mod do?
A: This mod introduces a vampire thief npc named Miriam. She's existed for a few hundred years and is quite insane. She joins your group because she is bored and needs some excitement in her unlife. This mod also has a store clerk who will upgrade items if you have the right combination. It also improves the encounters with the Unseeing Eye and the Harpers.

Q: Will this MOD add new quests or encounters to the Throne of Bhaal expansion?
A: No there are no new quests or encounters yet. There may be in a future release.

Q: Why did you decide to develop this MOD?
A: Originally this mod was Dark Ritual and Miriam as seperate mods. I combined the two mods because Dark Ritual had the Cult of Kali, a vampire cult and Miriam being a vampire, well these two had to come together.
