@100 = ~Greetings child I did not expect to see an Avariel far from her home. What is your name?~
@101 = ~M-my name is Aerie. How did you know I was an Avariel?~
@102 = ~I can tell by your facial features and the markings on your face. You are a practicer of magic yes?~
@103 = ~Y-yes ma'am. I am a mage and cleric. Quayle taught me the magical arts of a mage and I am a Priestess of Baervan.~
@104 = ~You're a priestess of a gnome god? I thought you may have chosen Aerdrie Faenya as your patron. But at least you use magic in a non-evil way. The Weave was not meant to be used for evil. Have you ever thought about Mystra?~
@105 = ~It does seem strange that an elf has a gnome god as a diety. I was saved by a gnome named Quayle and have adapted to his ways. I think of him as my father. T-this is why I play patronage to a gnome god. Aerdrie will always be in my heart since she is the mother of the Avariel. I-I always thought Mystra was a human goddess.~
@106 = ~No my child The Mother of the Weave has many followers to Her faith. Magic is in all races and beings and has no boundries. She loves all who use magic wisely and not for evil purposes. She welcomes all new comers to her faith.~
@107 = ~I will think of her, thank you ma'am.~
@108 = ~She will welcome you with open arms even if you have other gods to worship. I think your party members want to see what I have to offer them Aerie. It was nice talking to you.~
